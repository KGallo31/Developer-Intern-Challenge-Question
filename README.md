Hello Welcome to my verison of the 2022 Shopify
Developer Intern Challenge Question. I used ruby and ruby on rails to develope this web application. Its easy to use! There is already seeded data to use or start the app using the "rails s" command and start making request.


If deciding to use the already seeded data run the command "rails c" to test any already exisiting data or add new data.
